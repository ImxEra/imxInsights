!!! danger "Warning!"  

    - The goal of `imxInsights` is to extract information from imx files. **Please note that modifying, 
    adding, deleting, or altering data is beyond the scope of this module**.
    - `imxInsights` explicit supports imx versions 1.2.4, 5.0.0 and all major versions up to and including version 12.0.0.
    
!!! info "Audience"

    The intended audience for `imxInsights` consists of end users with basic Python knowledge. Therefore, the module offers a minimalistic API that is thoroughly documented. 
    We leverage the remarkable `makedocs` plugins to effortlessly generate a polished website from documentations and markdown files.


## This repository host the imx 12.0 implementation     

Transitioning from version 1.2.4 / 5.0.0 to 12.0.0 of this library necessitates extensive changes and significant code 
rewriting due to fundamental shifts in how imx files are utilized. Below, we outline a comprehensive roadmap that will 
be continually updated until we reach the first stable version.


!!! danger "New concept, breaking changes!"  
    ***This project is currently under active development and is not yet in its final form.***
    ***As such, there may be frequent changes, incomplete features, or potential instability.***

    ***-   We recommend using the stable and feature richer 0.1.0 release on for imx versions "1.2.4" and "5.0.0".***
